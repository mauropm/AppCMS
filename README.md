This is a collection of modules, settings and a custom theme that allows Drupal 6 to be used as a CMS for a mobile app. It can also be used to create a very mobile-friendly site but it's best when the flattened site is put inside the www folder of a PhoneGap project.

Note: At the moment, this throws the occasional error during install. This apparently has no effect on whether something has worked or not.

Installation Procedure
======================

 * Download Drupal 6
 * Unzip onto your server
 * Upload /profiles/appcms
 * Run the Drupal installer, choosing AppCMS as the Installation Profile
 <!-- * Upload the modules listed in modules/modules-README.txt This includes two customised modules:
   * html\_export - More thorough about changing src & href values
   * jquery\_update - Uses standard jQuery for Admin area, includes jQuery from theme if it exists -->



<!-- Install this standard theme
---------------------------
  * Seven (http://drupal.org/project/seven)

Install this custom theme
-------------------------
  * AppCMS

Use admin_theme to enable AppCMS as the default theme and Seven as the admin theme -->

<!-- Module settings
---------------
  * The jQuery Update module needs to be configured before use
    * Visit: /admin/settings/jquery\_update\_appcms

Set up the custom Calendar View by importing events_list.view

Events
------
  * There is already a Tab Bar menu item (/admin/build/menu-customize/primary-links) pointing to the URL 'calendar' (created in Views)
  * This will display an iCal-like calendar which includes any 'events' content.
  * Add events (/node/add/event)

The most recent code for the plugin behind the events calendar (available at /calendar) is available at:
https://github.com/thingsinjars/jQTouch-Calendar

HTML Export
===========
After export, change links in index.html from href="node/x" to href="pagex.html"
This bit still should be handled by html_export but double-check.

 * RegEx
	 * href="node/([0-9])*"
	 * to
	 * href="page$1.html"
 * Change all absolute references to relative
   * src="/ to src="
   * href="/ to href="
