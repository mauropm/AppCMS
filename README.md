This is a collection of modules, settings and a custom theme that allows Drupal 6 to be used as a CMS for a mobile app. It can also be used to create a very mobile-friendly site but it's best when the flattened site is put inside the www folder of a PhoneGap project.

Note: Some of these steps could probably be included in the Installation Profile but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.
Note 2: At the moment, this throws the occasional error during install. This apparently has no effect on whether something has worked or not.

Installation Procedure
======================

 * Download Drupal 6
 * Unzip onto your server
 * Upload /profiles/AppCMS/appcms.profile
 * Upload the modules listed in modules/modules-README.txt This includes two customised modules:
   * html\_export - More thorough about changing src & href values
   * jquery\_update - Uses standard jQuery for Admin area, includes jQuery from theme if it exists
 * Run the Drupal installer, choosing AppCMS as the Installation Profile
   * Depending on server configuration, you may see an error about flexifield. This is due to an overlapping dependency. It will go away on the next screen

HTML Export
===========
After export, change links in index.html from href="node/x" to href="pagex.html"
This bit still should be handled by html_export but double-check.

 * RegEx
	 * href="node/([0-9])*"
	 * to
	 * href="page$1.html"
 * Change all absolute references to relative
   * src="/ to src="
   * href="/ to href="
